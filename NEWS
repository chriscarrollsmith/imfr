@cjyetman for fixing.

## Version 0.1.2

##Â Version 0.1.1

- Updated URL GET request schema to meet changes introduced by the IMF on
2016-07-27. These changes had broke `imf_data`, but the issue is now resolved.
For more details on the API changes see:
<http://data.imf.org/?sk=A329021F-1ED6-4D6E-B719-5BF5413923B6>.

- `imf_data` now has an optional argument (`print_url`) that will print to the
URL used in the API to the console. This can be useful for API debugging.
